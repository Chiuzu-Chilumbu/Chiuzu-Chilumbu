- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, CI/CD Pipelines, Docker.
- **Cloud**: AWS.
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-bdd, Selenium, Postman.

## 📚 Projects

### Queue Data Structure with TDD and BDD
I extended my experimentation with data structures by implementing a Queue in Python, emphasizing TDD and BDD methodologies. The project is integrated with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous quality and seamless deployment.
