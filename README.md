# Hi there, I'm Chiuzu üëã

As a Software Engineer fueled by a passion for creating impeccable software, I navigate the tech landscape with TDD, BDD, and a keen interest in cloud computing. My commitment to software excellence is driven by a blend of innovation, continuous learning, and a relentless pursuit of simplifying complex challenges.

## üöÄ Who Am I?
An engineer at heart, innovator by practice, and perpetual learner by choice, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. My technical toolkit includes Python, JavaScript, and an array of technologies from Flask to Docker to AWS, all aimed at engineering solutions that matter.

## üí° My Philosophy
Quality, clarity, and efficiency guide my journey through the ever-evolving world of tech. With a solid foundation in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**, I craft code that not only works but is reliable.

## üî® Tools of the Trade
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL, Bash.
- **Frameworks/Platforms**: Flask, AWS Cloud.
- **DevOps & Test Automation**: Docker, Postman, Pytest, Selenium, Terraform.

## üìö Current Projects

### AWS Lambda Automation
I'm currently working on an AWS project that involves automating Lambda function deployments using Terraform and Bash scripts. This project aims to streamline the deployment process, ensuring reliability and operational efficiency in a cloud environment. It's a hands-on approach to mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and exploring the depths of AWS services.

### Graph Data Structure with TDD
I'm developing a Graph Data Structure using Python, leveraging both TDD and BDD to ensure reliability and correctness. This project includes the integration of Flask to create dynamic visualizations of the graph and its operations, such as DFS and BFS. The end goal is to visualize how different algorithms work on graphs in real-time, with the project hosted using GitHub Pages for easy accessibility and interaction.
