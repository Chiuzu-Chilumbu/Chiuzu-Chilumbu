# Hi there, I'm Chiuzu 👋

As a Software Engineer fueled by a passion for creating impeccable software, I navigate the tech landscape with TDD, BDD, and a keen interest in cloud computing. My commitment to software excellence is driven by a blend of innovation, continuous learning, and a relentless pursuit of simplifying complex challenges.

## 🚀 Who Am I?
An engineer at heart, innovator by practice, and perpetual learner by choice, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. My technical toolkit includes Python, JavaScript, and an array of technologies from Flask to Docker, all aimed at engineering solutions that matter.

## 💡 My Philosophy
Quality, clarity, and efficiency guide my journey through the ever-evolving world of tech. With a solid foundation in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**, I craft code that not only works but endures and inspires.

## 🔨 Tools of the Trade
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL, Bash.
- **Frameworks/Platforms**: Flask, AWS Cloud.
- **DevOps & Test Automation**: Docker, Postman, Pytest, Selenium

## 📚 Projects

### Queue Data Structure with TDD and BDD
I extended my experimentation with data structures by implementing a Queue in Python, emphasizing TDD and BDD methodologies. The project is integrated with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous quality and seamless deployment.
